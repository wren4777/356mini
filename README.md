# ps2avrW

ps2avrW is a continuation of inornate's original ps2avr. It is based on the layer-supporting variant of ps2avr that shipped with the OTD 356 Mini. It has been debloated and modified slightly so it can work with your custom keyboard projects.

## Obsolete60

The Obsolete60 is a 60% PCB I am working on. It will be the test vehicle for ps2avrW.

## AVR-Liberty

Instead of the original avrlib, this experimental branch is trialling avr-liberty by dreamiurg. https://github.com/dreamiurg/avr-liberty

## Credits

- inornate, for developing ps2avr and adapting it to the 356 mini,
- jkomusin, for hosting the 356's repo from which this is forked, and
- Xelus, for helping me with this project.

## Documentation

Coming soon. Watch this space.
